INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Download the compressed files corresponding to your Operating System (Windows 64 bits=Win64, Linux 64 bits=Linux64, or Windows 32 bits=Win32), and extract them into a folder of your choice:

* Under Win64, click on the gMetapop_GUI_Win64.exe to launch gMetapop_GUI, from which gMetapop_CORE_Win64.exe can be launched.

* Under Win32, click on the gMetapop_GUI_Win32.exe to launch gMetapop_GUI, from which gMetapop_CORE_Win32.exe can be launched.
 
* Under Linux64, unzip the linux version of the program then check that both GUI (i.e. gMetapop_GUI_Linux64) and CORE (i.e. gMetapop_CORE_Linux64) ...exe and ...sh (i.e. run_gM_GUI_Linux64.sh), and associated library (i.e. lib*) files have executable rights (If needed, type chmod +x filename to allow for executable permissions). Then in the folder where the files have been unzipped, type in command line:
"sh ./run_gM_GUI_Linux64.sh" or simply “./ run_gM_GUI_Linux64.sh"

NB: If a 32-bit GUI ...exe is used on a Win64 OS, or if either a 32-bit or 64-bit version are used on Windows 7 (not supported after 14th January 2020), most features of the programs should still work but you might get Windows errors that might (or not) stop the simulation runs and file production depending on particular scenarios.

In case of installation problems, in particular for gMetapop_GUI under some Linux OS, please contact Frédéric Raspail (frederic.raspail@inrae.fr) or Pauline Garnier-Géré (pauline.garnier-gere@inrae.fr)
