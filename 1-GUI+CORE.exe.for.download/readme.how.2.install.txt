Simply download the compressed files corresponding to your OS (either Windows 32 bits=Win32, Windows 64 bits=Win64, or Linux 64 bits (Linux64)) at the gMetapop website, and extract them to a folder of your choice:
Under 64-bit Windows, simply click on the gMetapop_GUI_Win64.exe for launching gMetapop_GUI, from which gMetapop_CORE_Win64.exe can be launched.
Under 32-bit Windows, click on the gMetapop_GUI_Win32.exe to launch gMetapop_GUI, from which gMetapop_CORE_Win32.exe can be launched.
Under 64-bit Linux, open a command line or Terminal window, unzip the linux version of the program then check that both GUI (i.e. gMetapop_GUI_Linux64) and CORE (i.e. gMetapop_CORE_Linux64) *.exe, *.sh (i.e. run_gM_GUI_Linux64.sh) and associated library (i.e. lib*) files have executable rights. In the folder where the files have been unzipped, type:
"sh ./run_gM_GUI_Linux64.sh" or simply “./ run_gM_GUI_Linux64.sh"
If needed, type chmod +x filename to allow for executable permissions. 

NB: We recommend using the 64-bit version for Win64 OS, and the 32-bit version for Win32 OS. If a 32-bit GUI *.exe is used on a Win64 OS, or if either a 32-bit or 64-bit version is used on Windows 7 (not supported after 14th January 2020), most features of the programs should still work but you might get Windows errors that might (or not) stop the simulation processes and file production depending on particular scenarios.

In case of installation problems, in particular for gMetapop_GUI under some Linux OS, please contact Frédéric Raspail (frederic.raspail@inrae.fr) or Pauline Garnier-Géré (pauline.garnier-gere@inrae.fr)
