**Examples for different formats of files that can be loaded into the GUI**

mu-rate-2-loc.txt: file with mutation rate mean values, which can be loaded into the GUI **Genome Tab** in the case of 2 loci, using the User-defined radio button.

mu-rate-3-loc.txt and mu-rate-5-loc.txt: other examples for mutation rate values of 3 or 5 loci with different numerical formats.

testmap2.txt: typical genetic map format, which can be loaded with the **Load Map** option of the **Genome Tab**

test9_initial_geno_format_notes.txt: example of a genotype data file with comments (same format for output and input files)

**Many other examples** of input and output files text files used in simulations can be found in the <A HREF="https://github.com/gMetapop/gMetapop/tree/master/5-Tutorials"> 5-Tutorials</A> folder: 
* More complex GENOTYPE FILES
* fitness values for Selection Tab
* selection intensity within population
* Optimal phenotypic values across populations
* Gene flow matrices
* Relative weight values for QTLs
