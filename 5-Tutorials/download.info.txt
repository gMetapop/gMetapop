All files and sub-folders for each tutorial can be downloaded separately from each corresponding folder (the ones not available yet will be very soon).

You can also download:
1) the minimum set of files necessary for recreating all configuration param xml files of the different tutorials.
These files are available in the recreate.xml.minimum.set.zip located here. 
2) The param xml files from all tutorials, available in param.xml.all.tutos.zip

Please refer to the User Manual Chapter 5 for a step-by-step guide to each tutorial.
