You can find here updated versions of the **Plot.gM.perGen.R** and **Plot.gM.perGen.zoom.R** scripts that allow to vizualise summary statistics across generations in simulation runs. Check the date of the script at the start of the file to make sure you have the last version. 

The files just need to be copied in the folder with executable files of gMetapop to replace current versions. A list of changes can be found here:

NB1: **Plot.gM.perGen.zoom.R** is just an extension of the default plot script to zoom between reproductive event x and y, with x above or equal to 0 and y below or equal to the total number of events in the simulation(s). The corresponding script plot.gM.perGen.zoom.r is also located in the *.exe* folder, and needs to be copied into working folders and used with the “Custom plot” option of the GUI File Menu (see command lines explained at the start of the script file or the User Manual 3.9.2 for more).

NB2: The **customp.rscript.zip** includes all R scripts for custom plots that are used in the tutorials of Chapter 5 of the User Manual.
