You can find here updated versions of the **Plot.gM.perGen.R** and **Plot.gM.perGen.zoom.R** scripts. 
These allow to vizualise summary statistics across generations from simulated results.
They are located in the program *.exe* folder. 
Check the update history below for changes and new versions since the 1.0.0 release (date to add). 

New versions of the scripts need to be copied in the *.exe* folder to replace current versions. A list of changes can be found here:

NB1: **Plot.gM.perGen.zoom.R** is just an extension of the default plot script to zoom between reproductive event x and y, with x above or equal to 0 and y below or equal to the total number of events in the simulation(s). The script needs to be copied into working folders and used with the “Custom plot” option of the **GUI File Menu** (see command lines explained at the script file start, or part 3.9.2 in the User Manual for more details).

NB2: The **customp.rscript.zip** includes all R scripts for custom plots that are used in the tutorials of Chapter 5 of the **User Manual <A HREF="https://github.com/gMetapop/gMetapop/tree/master/3-User.Manual-ver.1.0.0"> here</A>**
